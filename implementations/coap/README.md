# SocIoTy CoAP implementation

To generate all of the initial node and request configs:

```
cargo run --release --bin socioty_coap_init -- examples/init_config.toml
```

Then, on each node:
```
cargo run --release --bin socioty_coap_node -- $node
```
where `node` is a `.toml` file with the node's IP address.

To make a request:
```
cargo run --release --bin socioty_coap_request -- request_config.toml
```

You can change the nodes generated by `socioty_coap_init` by changing `examples/init_config.toml`. Make sure the generated `.toml`s are not added to source control!
