# Scripts
## Setup
1. Refer to .cargo/config.toml for target installation
2. Each node has been configured in .ssh/config as <node$i> where 1 <= i <= 12 
## Host contained scripts
### microbenchmark_deployment
usage: microbenchmark_deployment <build> <send>
- Goal: compile and deploy the target builds to the nodes
- *build* compiles both rpi 2/3 and rpi zero targets
- *send* sends the targts to the corresponding nodes
- note: uses colored output, could remove if script fails to load the module

### coap_benchmarking
usage: coap_benchmarking <configs> <run>
- Goal: Run coap benchmarking across the nodes. Host machine runs coap request and kills processes on the nodes through cleanup_procs script.
- *configs* generates config files for each node
- *run* Send configs files to the nodes, runs the test

### mqtt_benchmarking
usage: mqtt_benchmarking.sh <configs> <run>
- Goal: Run matt benchmarking across the nodes. Host machine runs coap request and kills processes on the nodes through cleanup_procs script.
- *configs* generates config files for each node
- *run* Send configs files to the nodes, runs the test

## Node contained scripts
### local_benchmarking
usage: local_benchmarking <number of rounds>
- Goal: Run socioty_benchmark_init and socioty_benchmark_reconstruct for *x* number of rounds
### cleanup_procs
usage: cleanup_procs <proc to kill>
- Goal: Run to kill coap node process 
- *proc to kill* process to kill on the node

# Data
## Microbenchmarks

Run date üìÖ: 24 Jan 2023 - 26 Jan 2023

‚ÄºÔ∏è Node11 has some crashes in the middle of its runs...

Under each node directory the files are of each test run with the computed run time. 
i.e. reconstruct_i_n_t.txt is the reconstruction with n nodes, threshold of t run i times.

## CoAP
Run date üìÖ: 29 Jan 2023

This data is a bit messy. Each file is the run_n_t_output.txt same as above. Inside each file has the iteration run times, the line with the duration look like so
```python
Duration: <time> (in milliseconds)
```
Simple grep and awk will work 
```bash
grep "Duration:" <file> | awk '{sum += $2} END {print sum/NR}'
```

## ESP32 Microbenchmarks
Run date üìÖ: 19 Feb 2023 - 20 Feb 2023

Each test run is named <test_type>_<device>_run_<n>_<t>.txt where n is number of nodes and t is the threshold.
**eval** and **init** output files contain the average on lines
```python
Average time <time>ms
```
**reconstruct** output files contain the average on lines
```python
Average reconstruct time <time>s
```
